= oVirt Go SDK Packaging

== Introduction

This directory contains the files required to package the SDK for
packaging systems other than the Go standard packaging system.

== RPM
The RPM .spec files in this directory are examples of how to package the
SDK, and are also used by the automation scripts to build the packages
with each commit.

If you want to use these RPM .spec files directly you will have to copy
the file corresponding to your distribution, rename it to
`go-ovirt-engine-sdk.spec` and adjust the `Version`, `Release` and
`Source` tags.
