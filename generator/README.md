# oVirt Engine Go SDK Generator

## Introduction

This project contains the code generator for the oVirt Go SDK.

The Java code use the `org.ovirt.api.metamodel` package, which
offered by oVirt team and describes details about all the model,
functions, class infomation. 

But the `metamodel` package is poorly documented, so I read
the Python SDK generator source code to learn everything.


> Maybe I should write some guides about how to generate SDK for 
other develop languanges. ^_^
